    "summary": "The first foray into computer recording, and it shows. While the songs are much more accessible, the production quality was still lacking. Despite having access to a software drum machine, I still opted to use a hardware one, and didn't sync it with the MIDI clock in the DAW as I did not know how. Ultimately, this made the remixing and remastering process for the deluxe edition years later... challenging. More than likely, you have heard the song \"Chickenz\" from this one as it is a famously stupid song.",

It's still weird, a bit tongue in cheek and stylistically all over the place, but I think it works. It also features the largest number of guest appearances of anything I've released. Fun fact, \"Kittens and Warm Cocoa\" was my first and only foray into Cookie Monster voice. Tony Raines made it sound so much better than the original demo. Also, \"Decipher This Song\" is not just a catchy title!",

As such, it is a maelstrom of negative emotions, with a few rays of hope sprinkled here and there. Track 5 (roughly translated as \"The Idol Guild\") is sung entirely in Vulcan. As in Spock.
